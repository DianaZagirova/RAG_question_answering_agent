  "question": "Does it suggest an aging biomarker?",
  "answer": "Based on the provided context, the papers discuss mechanisms and evolutionary hypotheses of aging, including its links to immunity, pathogen exposure, and physiological changes (e.g., immunosenescence, telomere maintenance, inflammation) [Source 1, Source 7, Source 9].

Most researchers believe aging is an entropic process or a detrimental side effect of some beneficial traits but not an adaptive program. A limited lifespan might provide benefits by preventing epidemics of infectious diseases. We propose that pathogenhost interac- tions are the primary reason for the evo- lution of adaptive programmed aging. Knowledge of the evolutionary origins of aging may instruct strategies to decipher its mechanisms and develop anti-aging interventions. 1Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA\n\n*Correspondence:  (P.V.

Aging: here refers to an increase of all-cause mortality with age; in physiology, a complex of age-related maladaptive changes. Senescence is used as synonym. Antagonistic pleiotropy: a major hypothesis proposing that aging results from late, detrimental activity of genes that were beneficial in youth. Such genes were named pleiotropic genes (Box 1). Biologically immortal: all-cause mortality does not depend on age. Damage accumulation: a group of mechanistic hypotheses that explain aging as the incremental acquisition of molecular lesions. Demographic structure: describes the age distribution of the population. A typical representation is a pyramid with youngest ages at the base and the oldest at the top. Fecundity and mortality define the shapes of these pyramids. Density-dependent dispersal: movements of animals dictated by population pressures. Disposable soma: postulates aging as the result of a trade-off between energy investments in reproduction and maintenance (Box 2). Eusociality: social structure in which typically only the breeders reproduce and other castes are reversibly or irreversibly sterile. Found in some insects (ants, bees, termites), mammals (mole-rats), and crustaceans.\n\n---\n[Source 5] Title: Could aging evolve as a pathogen control strategy? | DOI: 10.1016/j.tree.2022.08.003 | Section: Death | Relevance: 0.403\n(2020) Extreme mobility of the worlds larg- est flying mammals creates key challenges for management and conservation.

What is the role of pathogens with frequency-dependent transmission, in which transmission does not depend of population density (e.g., sexually transmitted pathogens)? Further, pathogen-induced sterilization is the critical element of the hypothesis, and studies of this aspect are essential to test it. Does infection between relatives occur more often than between random population members? Do structures of infection networks correlate with longevity? Do family and social structures affect infection networks and the evolution of lifespan? Can population structures explain longevity in highly mobile (e.g., flying) animals? Can population structures explain the asymmetry in longevity between differ- ent castes of eusocial species? Can protection from vertical pathogen transmission explain the evolution of semelparity? Are naked mole-rats hypersensitive to infection? The pathogen control hy- pothesis suggests that adaptive sui- cide (phenoptosis) in response to infection may be an alternative way to control pathogens that can make aging redundant. We expect naked mole-rats to be very susceptible to dis- eases and the workers to be less toler- ant than the queens.
