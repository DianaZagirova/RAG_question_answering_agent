    "title": "Modulation of the inter-hemispheric processing of semantic information during normal aging. A divided visual field experiment.",
    "abstract": "We evaluated the effect of normal aging on the inter-hemispheric processing of semantic information by using the divided visual field (DVF) method, with words and pictures. Two main theoretical models have been considered, (a) the HAROLD model which posits that aging is associated with supplementary recruitment of the right hemisphere (RH) and decreased hemispheric specialization, and (b) the RH decline theory, which assumes that the RH becomes less efficient with aging, associated with increased LH specialization. Two groups of subjects were examined, a Young Group (YG) and an Old Group (OG), while participants performed a semantic categorization task (living vs. non-living) in words and pictures. The DVF was realized in two steps: (a) unilateral DVF presentation with stimuli presented separately in each visual field, left or right, allowing for their initial processing by only one hemisphere, right or left, respectively; (b) bilateral DVF presentation (BVF) with stimuli presented simultaneously in both visual fields, followed by their processing by both hemispheres. These two types of presentation permitted the evaluation of two main characteristics of the inter-hemispheric processing of information, the hemispheric specialization (HS) and the inter-hemispheric cooperation (IHC). Moreover, the BVF allowed determining the driver-hemisphere for processing information presented in BVF. Results obtained in OG indicated that: (a) semantic categorization was performed as accurately as YG, even if more slowly, (b) a non-semantic RH decline was observed, and (c) the LH controls the semantic processing during the BVF, suggesting an increased role of the LH in aging. However, despite the stronger involvement of the LH in OG, the RH is not completely devoid of semantic abilities. As discussed in the paper, neither the HAROLD nor the RH decline does fully explain this pattern of results. We rather suggest that the effect of aging on the hemispheric specialization and inter-hemispheric cooperation during semantic processing is explained not by only one model, but by an interaction between several complementary mechanisms and models.",

    "title": "Miswired Proprioception in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Relation to Pain Sensation (and in Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness)-Is Piezo2 Channelopathy a Principal Transcription Activator in Proprioceptive Terminals Besides Being the Potential Primary Damage?",
    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal neurodegenerative multisystem disease, with an unknown pathomechanism, resulting in progressive motoneuron loss. In 90-95% of cases, ALS is sporadic, but close to 10% of ALS is familial with inherited gene mutations from family members. Recently, a non-contact dying-back injury mechanism theory of ALS postulated that irreversible intrafusal proprioceptive terminal degeneration induces the non-resolving progressive impairment of the proprioceptive circuitry, leading to motoneuron loss, progressive overloading and depletion of the central nervous system, and eventually to death. The current manuscript proposes that irreversible Piezo2 channelopathy of this proprioceptive terminal degeneration induces constantly activated and dysregulated transcription process in ALS, providing access to underlying pathogenic gene variants and letting the cell-type-specific noncoding DNA mutations become more apparent. This opinion piece proposes that ALS genes are associated with the Piezo2 channelopathy mechanism both downstream and upstream, and their mutations, along with the aging process, could explain the non-contact dying-back injury mechanism theory of ALS. Moreover, irreversible microinjury of the Piezo2 ion channel could be the primary damage or the root cause of death in ALS. Finally, the current manuscript also depicts the pathomechanism as to why ALS is considered a painless disease.",

    "abstract": "Calorie restriction extends longevity and delays ageing in model organisms and mammals, opposing the onset and progression of an array of age-related diseases. These beneficial effects also extend to the maintenance of brain cognitive functions at later age and to the prevention, at least in rodents, of brain senescence and associated neurodegenerative disorders. In recent years, the molecular mechanisms underlying brain response to calorie restriction have begun to be elucidated, revealing the unanticipated role of a number of key nutrient sensors and nutrient-triggered signaling cascades in the translation of metabolic cues into cellular and molecular events that ultimately lead to increased cell resistance to stress, enhanced synaptic plasticity, and improved cognitive performance. Of note, the brain's role in CR also includes the activation of nutrient-sensitive hypothalamic circuitries and the implementation of neuroendocrine responses that impact the entire organism. The present review addresses emerging molecular themes in brain response to dietary restriction, and the implications of this knowledge for the understanding and the prevention of brain disorders associated with ageing and metabolic disease.",

    "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by a pervasive collapse of proteostasis, while reducing general protein synthesis promotes longevity across taxa. Here, we show that the eIF4E isoform IFE-2 is increasingly sequestered in mRNA processing (P) bodies during aging and upon stress in Caenorhabditis elegans. Loss of the enhancer of mRNA decapping EDC-3 causes further entrapment of IFE-2 in P bodies and lowers protein synthesis rates in somatic tissues. Animals lacking EDC-3 are long lived and stress resistant, congruent with IFE-2-deficient mutants. Notably, neuron-specific expression of EDC-3 is sufficient to reverse lifespan extension, while sequestration of IFE-2 in neuronal P bodies counteracts age-related neuronal decline. The effects of mRNA decapping deficiency on stress resistance and longevity are orchestrated by a multimodal stress response involving the transcription factor SKN-1, which mediates lifespan extension upon reduced protein synthesis. Our findings elucidate a mechanism of proteostasis control during aging through P body-mediated regulation of protein synthesis in the soma.",

    "abstract": "Calorie restriction is the most powerful method currently known to delay aging-associated disease and extend lifespan. Use of this technique in combination with genetic models has led to identification of key metabolic regulators of lifespan. Limiting energy availability by restricting caloric intake leads to redistribution of energy expenditure and storage. The signaling required for these metabolic changes is mediated in part by the sirtuins at both the posttranslational and transcriptional levels, and consequently, sirtuins are recognized as instigating factors in the regulation of lifespan. This family of class III protein deacetylases is responsible for directing energy regulation based on NAD(+) availability. However, there are many effectors of NAD(+) availability, and hence sirtuin action, that should be considered when performing experiments using calorie restriction. The methods outlined in this chapter are intended to provide a guide to help the aging community to use and interpret experimental calorie restriction properly. The importance of healthspan and the use of repeated measures to assess metabolic health during lifespan experiments are strongly emphasized.",

    "abstract": "Hypothalamic dysfunction has emerged as an important mechanism involved in the development of obesity and its comorbidities, as well as in the process of ageing and age-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and Alzheimer disease. In both obesity and ageing, inflammatory signalling is thought to coordinate many of the cellular events that lead to hypothalamic neuronal dysfunction. This process is triggered by the activation of signalling via the toll-like receptor 4 pathway and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which in turn results in intracellular inflammatory signalling. However, the process that connects inflammation with neuronal dysfunction is complex and includes several regulatory mechanisms that ultimately control the homeostasis of intracellular proteins and organelles (also known as 'proteostasis'). This Review discusses the evidence for the key role of proteostasis in the control of hypothalamic neurons and the involvement of this process in regulating whole-body energy homeostasis and lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Calorie restriction (CR) has been shown to decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and retard aging in a variety of species. It has been proposed that alterations in membrane saturation are central to these actions of CR. As a step towards testing this theory, mice were assigned to 4 dietary groups (control and 3 CR groups) and fed AIN-93G diets at 95 % (control) or 60 % (CR) of ad libitum for 8 months. To manipulate membrane composition, the primary dietary fats for the CR groups were soybean oil (also used in the control diet), fish oil or lard. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial lipid composition, proton leak, and H(2)O(2) production were measured. Phospholipid fatty acid composition in CR mice was altered in a manner that reflected the n-3 and n-6 fatty acid profiles of their respective dietary lipid sources. Dietary lipid composition did not alter proton leak kinetics between the CR groups. However, the capacity of mitochondrial complex III to produce ROS was decreased in the CR lard compared to the other CR groups. The results of this study indicate that dietary lipid composition can influence ROS production in muscle mitochondria of CR mice. It remains to be determined if lard or other dietary oils can maximize the CR-induced decreases in ROS production.",

    "title": "Effect of aerobic exercise training on mtDNA deletion in soleus muscle of trained and untrained Wistar rats.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: According to the theory of mitochondrial aging, oxidative stress plays a major role in aging and age related degenerative diseases. Since oxygen consumption and reactive oxygen species rate increase during aerobic exercise, we hypothesised that heavy aerobic training could lead to enhanced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion in postmitotic tissues, leading in turn to premature aging and degenerative diseases. METHODS: Sixty adult male 2 month old Wistar14848 rats were divided into six equal groups. Two groups were trained for 3 months by running on a treadmill (5 days/week, incline 6 degrees; group 1: 40 m/min, 20 min/day; group 2: 20 m/min, 40 min/day), while two sedentary groups participated in aerobic exercise only at the end of the study (incline 6 degrees; group 3: 40 m/min; group 4: 20 m/min). To control for physical and physiological parameters, two groups of untrained animals were killed at the beginning (group 6) and end (group 5) of the study. Expand long PCR was used to investigate mtDNA deletion in soleus muscle and a sequencing method was used to confirm the mtDNA deletion break point. RESULTS: Our results did not show any mtDNA deletion in untrained rats or in those that underwent moderate training (group 2) We only found mtDNA deletion (4.6 kb) in the soleus muscle of heavily trained rats (group 1). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that one session of aerobic exercise does not cause mtDNA deletion in skeletal muscle. The difference in results between heavy and moderate aerobic training may be due to low work rate or up-regulation of inducible antioxidant systems in moderate training.",

    "title": "A Reassessment of Genes Modulating Aging in Mice Using Demographic Measurements of the Rate of Aging.",
    "abstract": "Many studies have reported genetic interventions that have an effect on mouse life span; however, it is crucial to discriminate between manipulations of aging and aging-independent causes of life extension. Here, we used the Gompertz equation to determine whether previously reported aging-related mouse genes statistically affect the demographic rate of aging. Of 30 genetic manipulations previously reported to extend life span, for only two we found evidence of retarding demographic aging: <i>Cisd2</i> and <i>hMTH1</i> Of 24 genetic manipulations reported to shorten life span and induce premature aging features, we found evidence of five accelerating demographic aging: <i>Casp2</i>, <i>Fn1</i>, <i>IKK</i>-β, <i>JunD</i>, and <i>Stub1</i> Overall, our reassessment found that only 15% of the genetic manipulations analyzed significantly affected the demographic rate of aging as predicted, suggesting that a relatively small proportion of interventions affecting longevity do so by regulating the rate of aging. By contrast, genetic manipulations affecting longevity tend to impact on aging-independent mortality. Our meta-analysis of multiple mouse longevity studies also reveals substantial variation in the controls used across experiments, suggesting that a short life span of controls is a potential source of bias. Overall, the present work leads to a reassessment of genes affecting the aging process in mice, with broad implications for our understanding of the genetics of mammalian aging and which genes may be more promising targets for drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Aging is an intricate process characterized by multiple hallmarks including stem cell exhaustion, genome instability, epigenome alteration, impaired proteostasis, and cellular senescence. Whereas each of these traits is detrimental at the cellular level, it remains unclear how they are interconnected to cause systemic organ deterioration. Here we show that abrogating Brap, a BRCA1-associated protein essential for neurogenesis, results in persistent DNA double-strand breaks and elevation of histone H2A mono- and poly-ubiquitination (H2Aub). These defects extend to cellular senescence and proteasome-mediated histone H2A proteolysis with alterations in cells' proteomic and epigenetic states. Brap deletion in the mouse brain causes neuroinflammation, impaired proteostasis, accelerated neurodegeneration, and substantially shortened the lifespan. We further show the elevation of H2Aub also occurs in human brain tissues with Alzheimer's disease. These data together suggest that chromatin aberrations mediated by H2Aub may act as a nexus of multiple aging hallmarks and promote tissue-wide degeneration.",

These initial studies sparked efforts by many laboratories working in diverse model organisms to elucidate the relations between sirtuins, lifespan, and age-associated dysfunction. Here, we discuss the current understanding of how sirtuins relate to aging. We focus primarily on mammalian sirtuins SIRT1, SIRT3, and SIRT6, the three sirtuins for which the most relevant data are available. Strikingly, a large body of evidence now indicates that these and other mammalian sirtuins suppress a variety of age-related pathologies and promote healthspan. Moreover, increased expression of SIRT1 or SIRT6 extends mouse lifespan. Overall, these data point to important roles for sirtuins in promoting mammalian health, and perhaps in modulating the aging process.",

    "title": "Antagonistic Pleiotropy in Human Disease.",
    "abstract": "Between the 1930s and 1950s, scientists developed key principles of population genetics to try and explain the aging process. Almost a century later, these aging theories, including antagonistic pleiotropy and mutation accumulation, have been experimentally validated in animals. Although the theories have been much harder to test in humans despite research dating back to the 1970s, recent research is closing this evidence gap. Here we examine the strength of evidence for antagonistic pleiotropy in humans, one of the leading evolutionary explanations for the retention of genetic risk variation for non-communicable diseases. We discuss the analytical tools and types of data that are used to test for patterns of antagonistic pleiotropy and provide a primer of evolutionary theory on types of selection as a guide for understanding this mechanism and how it may manifest in other diseases. We find an abundance of non-experimental evidence for antagonistic pleiotropy in many diseases. In some cases, several studies have independently found corroborating evidence for this mechanism in the same or related sets of diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies also suggest antagonistic pleiotropy may be involved in cardiovascular disease and diabetes. There are also compelling examples of disease risk variants that confer fitness benefits ranging from resistance to other diseases or survival in extreme environments. This provides increasingly strong support for the theory that antagonistic pleiotropic variants have enabled improved fitness but have been traded for higher burden of disease later in life. Future research in this field is required to better understand how this mechanism influences contemporary disease and possible consequences for their treatment.",

    "abstract": "MRG15, a chromatin remodeling protein, plays a pivotal role in cellular senescence and proliferation. However, the precise roles and mechanisms of MRG15 in aging regulation remain unclear. Our research elucidates the distinct functions of MRG15's splice variants in aging. We find that MRG15L, contrary to the previously assumed MRG15S, accumulates with advancing age. Using histone peptide binding assays and protein interaction analysis, we demonstrate that MRG15L exhibits reduced affinity for histone H4 acetylation sites, thereby weakening CDK1 regulation, leading to G2/M phase arrest and promoting cellular senescence. During postnatal cardiac development, MRG15L expression increases and is linked to reduced regenerative capacity. Moreover, targeted knockout of MRG15L in mice enhances cardiac repair and regeneration following myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. These findings highlight MRG15L as a promising therapeutic target for age-related diseases, revealing its critical role in modulating aging pathways through alternative splicing.",

    "abstract": "With the increase in the number of people with advanced age (> 60 years) worldwide, it is necessary to understand the processes that lead to healthy aging. Cellular senescence, immunosenescence and inflammaging are part of the natural process of aging and are associated with age-related diseases. Cellular senescence is characterized by the arrest of the cell cycle in the G1 phase. Senescent cells can be identified by different markers (surface or intracellular), by changes in their functions, and by their gene expression profile. Immunosenescence causes dysregulation of the immune response, with persistent (chronic) increases in inflammatory mediators and decreases in the effectiveness of immune effector responses, which promotes the development and severity of chronic-degenerative diseases and fragility. When immunosenescence is related with advanced age, it is known as inflammaging. New strategies to revert immunosenescence are currently being investigated, with senotherapy with senolytic drugs that eliminate senescent cells, and with senomorphic drugs that inhibit the secretion of senescence-promoting mediators. Senolytic drugs may be useful during the aging process, to delay, prevent and/or improve age-related diseases.",

These alterations are often accompanied by epigenetic changes in histone modifications. We review, here, the role of nuclear envelope proteins and histone modifiers in the 3-dimensional organization of the genome and the implications for gene expression. In particular, we focus on the nuclear lamins and the chromatin-associated protein BAF, which are linked to Hutchinson-Gilford and Nestor-Guillermo progeria syndromes, respectively.

    "title": "Does food restriction retard aging by reducing the metabolic rate?",
    "abstract": "Metabolic rate was determined by measuring O2 consumption in two groups of 6-mo-old male rats fed ad libitum (group 1) or maintained on a life-prolonging food-restriction regimen for 4.5 mo (group 2). These measurements were made continuously for 23.75 h under conditions nearly identical to those of the daily life of the rats. The metabolic rate per kilogram lean body mass was the same for both groups, a finding contrary to the hypothesis that food restriction retards the aging process and prolongs life by slowing the metabolic rate per unit of metabolic mass. This and our previous work strongly suggest that the classic views of the action of food restriction on aging must be re-evaluated because retardation of the aging process can occur without the restriction of calories or any other nutrient per unit of lean body mass. The long held belief that reducing food intake lowers the metabolic rate per unit of metabolic mass may be true in short-term dietary programs but appears not to be true when a significant portion of the life span is involved.",

    "abstract": "In order to delineate biochemical alterations during gamete senescence leucine uptake and incorporation in aging mouse eggs were investigated. One hour after ovulation eggs were removed from the oviducts and labeled (unaged) or incubated for 24 hours before labeling (in vitro aged) with [3H]leucine. In vivo aged eggs were removed from the oviducts 25 hours after ovulation and incubated in medium containing [3H]leucine. Aging of eggs for 24 hours resulted in a significant increase in the accumulation of [3H]leucine. The observed increase was larger in ova aged in vitro than in vivo, indicating that culture conditions affect leucine accumulation. Comparison of in vitro aged and unaged eggs revealed no significant difference in net leucine incorporation in to acid-insoluble material. In addition to previously documented morphological alterations, the data presented herein describe some of the biochemical changes that accompany aging of the mouse ovum. These results are discussed in light of theories of aging proposed for somatic cells.",

    "abstract": "Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is thought to be an important mechanism for preventing the adverse effects of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and its absence has been associated with premature aging. To investigate the effect of inactivated NHEJ on spontaneous mutation frequencies and spectra in vivo and in cultured cells, we crossed a Ku80-deficient mouse with mice harboring a lacZ-plasmid-based mutation reporter. We analyzed various organs and tissues, as well as cultured embryonic fibroblasts, for mutations at the lacZ locus. When comparing mutant with wild-type mice, we observed a significantly higher number of genome rearrangements in liver and spleen and a significantly lower number of point mutations in liver and brain. The reduced point mutation frequency was not due to a decrease in small deletion mutations thought to be a hallmark of NHEJ, but could be a consequence of increased cellular responses to unrepaired DSBs. Indeed, we found a substantial increase in persistent 53BP1 and gammaH2AX DNA damage foci in Ku80-/- as compared to wild-type liver. Treatment of cultured Ku80-deficient or wild-type embryonic fibroblasts, either proliferating or quiescent, with hydrogen peroxide or bleomycin showed no differences in the number or type of induced genome rearrangements. However, after such treatment, Ku80-deficient cells did show an increased number of persistent DNA damage foci. These results indicate that Ku80-dependent repair of DNA damage is predominantly error-free with the effect of alternative more error-prone pathways creating genome rearrangements only detectable after extended periods of time, i.e., in young adult animals. The observed premature aging likely results from a combination of increased cellular senescence and an increased load of stable, genome rearrangements.",

    "title": "Red blood cells open promising avenues for longitudinal studies of ageing in laboratory, non-model and wild animals.",
    "abstract": "Ageing is characterized by a progressive deterioration of multiple physiological and molecular pathways, which impair organismal performance and increase risks of death with advancing age. Hence, ageing studies must identify physiological and molecular pathways that show signs of age-related deterioration, and test their association with the risk of death and longevity. This approach necessitates longitudinal sampling of the same individuals, and therefore requires a minimally invasive sampling technique that provides access to the larger spectrum of physiological and molecular pathways that are putatively associated with ageing. The present paper underlines the interest in using red blood cells (RBCs) as a promising target for longitudinal studies of ageing in vertebrates. RBCs provide valuable information on the following six pathways: cell maintenance and turnover (RBC number, size, and heterogeneity), glucose homeostasis (RBC glycated haemoglobin), oxidative stress parameters, membrane composition and integrity, mitochondrial functioning, and telomere dynamics. The last two pathways are specific to RBCs of non-mammalian species, which possess a nucleus and functional mitochondria. We present the current knowledge about RBCs and age-dependent changes in these pathways in non-model and wild species that are especially suitable to address questions related to ageing using longitudinal studies. We discuss how the different pathways relate with survival and lifespan and give information on their genetic and environmental determinants to appraise their evolutionary potential.",

A multitude of factors and pathways guides this process and includes repair proteins and cell cycle checkpoint factors. Differences in the maintenance of genomic processes are one feature that may contribute to species-specific differences in lifespan. We predicted that 53BP1, a key transducer of the DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoint control, is highly involved in maintaining genomic stability and may function differently in cells from different species. We demonstrate a difference in the levels and recruitment of 53BP1 in mouse and human cells following DNA damage. In addition, we show that unresolved DNA damage persists more in mouse cells than in human cells, as evidenced by increased numbers of micronuclei. The difference in micronuclei seems to be related to the levels of 53BP1 present in cells. Finally, we present evidence that unresolved DNA damage correlates with species lifespan. Taken together, these studies suggest a link between recruitment of 53BP1, resolution of DNA damage, and increased species lifespan.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to improve our understanding of the factors that promote healthy cognitive aging and combat dementia. Aging theories that consider individual aging trajectories are of paramount importance to meet the WHO's aim. Both the revised Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition (STAC-r) and Cognitive Reserve theory (CR) offer theoretical frameworks for the mechanisms of cognitive aging and the positive influence of an engaged lifestyle. STAC-r additionally considers adverse factors, such as depression. The two theories explain different though partly overlapping aspects of cognitive aging. Currently, it is unclear where the theories agree and differ and what compensation mechanism of age-related cognitive decline might be better explained by either STAC-r, CR, or by both. This review provides an essential discussion of the similarities and differences between these prominent cognitive aging theories, their implications for intervention methods and neurodegenerative disease, and significant shortcomings that have not yet been addressed. This review will direct researchers to common insights in the field and to intervention targets and testable hypotheses for future research. Future research should investigate the potential use of STAC-r in neurodegenerative diseases and provide clarity as to what combination of factors build CR, including their relative importance and when in life they are most effective.",

    "abstract": "The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signalling (IIS) pathway regulates cellular and organismal metabolism and controls the rate of aging. Gain-of-function mutations in p110α, the principal mammalian IIS-responsive isoform of PI 3-kinase (PI3K), promote cancer. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in p110α impair insulin signalling and cause insulin resistance, inducing a pre-diabetic state. It remains unknown if long-term p110α inactivation induces further metabolic deterioration over time, leading to overt unsustainable pathology. Surprisingly, we find that chronic p110α partial inactivation in mice protects from age-related reduction in insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance and fat accumulation, and extends the lifespan of male mice. This beneficial effect of p110α inactivation derives in part from a suppressed down-regulation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) protein levels induced by age-related hyperinsulinemia, and correlates with enhanced insulin-induced Akt signalling in aged p110α-deficient mice. This temporal metabolic plasticity upon p110α inactivation indicates that prolonged PI3K inhibition, as intended in human cancer treatment, might not negatively impact on organismal metabolism.",

    "title": "TGFB-INHB/activin signaling regulates age-dependent autophagy and cardiac health through inhibition of MTORC2.",
    "abstract": "Age-related impairment of macroautophagy/autophagy and loss of cardiac tissue homeostasis contribute significantly to cardiovascular diseases later in life. MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) signaling is the most well-known regulator of autophagy, cellular homeostasis, and longevity. The MTOR signaling consists of two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes, MTORC1 and MTORC2. While MTORC1 is well characterized but the role of MTORC2 in aging and autophagy remains poorly understood. Here we identified TGFB-INHB/activin signaling as a novel upstream regulator of MTORC2 to control autophagy and cardiac health during aging. Using <i>Drosophila</i> heart as a model system, we show that cardiac-specific knockdown of TGFB-INHB/activin-like protein daw induces autophagy and alleviates age-related heart dysfunction, including cardiac arrhythmias and bradycardia. Interestingly, the downregulation of <i>daw</i> activates TORC2 signaling to regulate cardiac autophagy. Activation of TORC2 alone through overexpressing its subunit protein rictor promotes autophagic flux and preserves cardiac function with aging. In contrast, activation of TORC1 does not block autophagy induction in <i>daw</i> knockdown flies. Lastly, either <i>daw</i> knockdown or <i>rictor</i> overexpression in fly hearts prolongs lifespan, suggesting that manipulation of these pathways in the heart has systemic effects on longevity control. Thus, our studies discover the TGFB-INHB/activin-mediated inhibition of TORC2 as a novel mechanism for age-dependent decreases in autophagic activity and cardiac health. <b>Abbreviations:</b> AI: arrhythmia index; BafA1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; BMP: bone morphogenetic protein; CQ: chloroquine; CVD: cardiovascular diseases; DI: diastolic interval; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; HP: heart period; HR: heart rate; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; NGS: normal goat serum; PBST: PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100; PDPK1: 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1; RICTOR: RPTOR independent companion of MTOR complex 2; ROI: region of interest; ROUT: robust regression and outlier removal; ROS: reactive oxygen species; R-SMAD: receptor-activated SMAD; SI: systolic interval; SOHA: semi-automatic optical heartbeat analysis; TGFB: transformation growth factor beta; TSC1: TSC complex subunit 1.",

    "title": "Does bristlecone pine senesce?",
    "abstract": "We evaluated hypotheses of senescence in old trees by comparing putative biomarkers of aging in Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) ranging in age from 23 to 4713 years. To test a hypothesis that water and nutrient conduction is impaired in old trees we examined cambial products in the xylem and phloem. We found no statistically significant age-related changes in tracheid diameter, or in several other parameters of xylem and phloem related to cambial function. The hypothesis of continuously declining annual shoot growth increments was tested by comparing trees of varying ages in regard to stem unit production and elongation. No statistically significant age-related differences were found. The hypothesis that aging results from an accumulation of deleterious mutations was addressed by comparing pollen viability, seed weight, seed germinability, seedling biomass accumulation, and frequency of putative mutations, in trees of varying ages. None of these parameters had a statistically significant relationship to tree age. Thus, we found no evidence of mutational aging. It appears that the great longevity attained by some Great Basin bristlecone pines is unaccompanied by deterioration of meristem function in embryos, seedlings, or mature trees, an intuitively necessary manifestation of senescence. We conclude that the concept of senescence does not apply to these trees.",

The relevance of these studies to ageing in other organisms has, however, been questioned, since this yeast divides by budding rather than fission, the more common pattern in higher organisms. Here we report that, contrary to popular belief, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe also undergoes replicative senescence and in a manner superficially analogous to budding yeast. These experiments provide the first evidence of age asymmetry in cell fission and are consistent with the hypothesis of Jazwinski, that asymmetric division underlies culture immortality. Given their evolutionary divergence, comparison of the ageing determinants in fission and budding yeasts may help identify common mechanisms of the ageing process.",

    "title": "Mitochondrial involvement in brain function and dysfunction: relevance to aging, neurodegenerative disorders and longevity.",
    "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly evident that the mitochondrial genome may play a key role in neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction is characteristic of several neurodegenerative disorders, and evidence for mitochondria being a site of damage in neurodegenerative disorders is partially based on decreases in respiratory chain complex activities in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. Such defects in respiratory complex activities, possibly associated with oxidant/antioxidant balance perturbation, are thought to underlie defects in energy metabolism and induce cellular degeneration. Efficient functioning of maintenance and repair process seems to be crucial for both survival and physical quality of life. This is accomplished by a complex network of the so-called longevity assurance processes, which are composed of genes termed vitagenes. A promising approach for the identification of critical gerontogenic processes is represented by the hormesis-like positive effect of stress. In the present review, we discuss the role of energy thresholds in brain mitochondria and their implications in neurodegeneration. We then review the evidence for the role of oxidative stress in modulating the effects of mitochondrial DNA mutations on brain age-related disorders and also discuss new approaches for investigating the mechanisms of lifetime survival and longevity.",

    "title": "Frailty and sarcopenia: The potential role of an aged immune system.",
    "abstract": "Frailty is a common negative consequence of ageing. Sarcopenia, the syndrome of loss of muscle mass, quality and strength, is more common in older adults and has been considered a precursor syndrome or the physical manifestation of frailty. The pathophysiology of both syndromes is incompletely described with multiple causes, inter-relationships and complex pathways proposed. Age-associated changes to the immune system (both immunesenescence, the decline in immune function with ageing, and inflammageing, a state of chronic inflammation) have been suggested as contributors to sarcopenia and frailty but a direct causative role remains to be established. Frailty, sarcopenia and immunesenescence are commonly described in older adults but are not ubiquitous to ageing. There is evidence that all three conditions are reversible and all three appear to share common inflammatory drivers. It is unclear whether frailty, sarcopenia and immunesenescence are separate entities that co-occur due to coincidental or potentially confounding factors, or whether they are more intimately linked by the same underlying cellular mechanisms. This review explores these possibilities focusing on innate immunity, and in particular associations with neutrophil dysfunction, inflammation and known mechanisms described to date. Furthermore, we consider whether the age-related decline in immune cell function (such as neutrophil migration), increased inflammation and the dysregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway in neutrophils could contribute pathogenically to sarcopenia and frailty.",

    "abstract": "Studying the genome of centenarians may give insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying extreme human longevity and the escape of age-related diseases. Here, we set out to construct polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for longevity and to investigate the functions of longevity-associated variants. Using a cohort of centenarians with maintained cognitive health (N = 343), a population-matched cohort of older adults from 5 cohorts (N = 2905), and summary statistics data from genome-wide association studies on parental longevity, we constructed a PRS including 330 variants that significantly discriminated between centenarians and older adults. This PRS was also associated with longer survival in an independent sample of younger individuals (p = .02), leading up to a 4-year difference in survival based on common genetic factors only. We show that this PRS was, in part, able to compensate for the deleterious effect of the APOE-ε4 allele. Using an integrative framework, we annotated the 330 variants included in this PRS by the genes they associate with. We find that they are enriched with genes associated with cellular differentiation, developmental processes, and cellular response to stress. Together, our results indicate that an extended human life span is, in part, the result of a constellation of variants each exerting small advantageous effects on aging-related biological mechanisms that maintain overall health and decrease the risk of age-related diseases.",

    "title": "Females live longer than males: role of oxidative stress.",
    "abstract": "One of the most significant achievements of the twentieth century is the increase in human lifespan. In any period studied, females live longer than males. We showed that mitochondrial oxidative stress is higher in males than females and that the higher levels of estrogens in females protect them against ageing, by up-regulating the expression of antioxidant, longevity-related genes. The chemical structure of estradiol confers antioxidant properties to the molecule. However, the low concentration of estrogens in females makes it unlikely that they exhibit significant antioxidant capacity in the organism. Therefore we studied the mechanisms enabling estradiol to be antioxidant at physiological levels. Our results show that physiological concentrations of estrogens activate estrogen receptors and the MAPK and NFKB pathway. Activation of NFkB by estrogens subsequently activates the expression of Mn-SOD and GPx. Moreover, we have demonstrated that genistein, the most abundant phytoestrogen in soya, reproduces the antioxidant effect of estradiol at nutritionally relevant concentrations by the same mechanism, both in healthy ageing and in Alzheimer's disease. We conclude that estrogens and phytoestrogens up-regulate expression of antioxidant enzymes via the estrogen receptor and MAPK activation, which in turn activate the NFkB signalling pathway, resulting in the up-regulation of the expression of longevity-related genes.",

We review studies that use brain as a tissue to test the validity of the DNA damage and repair hypothesis of aging. As far as the accumulation of age dependent DNA damage is concerned, the data appear to overwhelmingly support the hypothesis. However, attempts to demonstrate a decline in DNA repair capacity as a function of age are conflicting and equally divided. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. It is suggested that assessment of the repair capacity of neurons with respect to a specific type of damage in a specific gene might yield more definitive answers regarding the role of DNA repair potential in the aging process and as a longevity assurance system.",

Nevertheless, despite the existence of forkhead family homologues in yeast, our knowledge of these proteins' role in yeast longevity is limited. Here, we show that yeast Hcm1p forkhead is the closest homologue of the worm PHA-4 forkhead, which regulates Caenorhabditis elegans life span. Overexpressing the yeast forkhead HCM1 or its deficiency resulted in a significant extension or reduction in yeast replicative life span, respectively. HCM1 regulates stress resistance, significantly increases the mRNA levels of several stress response genes including the catalase enzymes CTA1 and CTT1, and positively regulates life span independently of calorie restriction. Thus, HCM1 is a key regulator of life span, through a mechanism independent of calorie restriction.",

    "abstract": "Menopause and reproductive senescence can be more fully understood by examining these phenomena where they occur in nonhuman mammals, as well as humans, and especially by comparisons among primates. In addition to concerns about human health and welfare, successful programs for wildlife management and agriculture, and the propagation and conservation of endangered species depend on detailed understanding of reproduction and fertility throughout the life span. Appropriate care of elderly primates in zoological gardens also requires knowledge of their health, behavior, and reproductive status. Information on female primate fertility, reproductive senescence, and associated health-risks is scattered throughout the scientific literature, and includes emphases ranging from comparative medicine and primate models of human health to zoology and human evolution. This chapter introduces a range of issues and reviews studies of female primate reproductive senescence and menopause. These topics are examined in greater depth in the subsequent chapters of this volume.",

    "abstract": "Ageing and the mortality that ensues are sustainable for the species only if age is reset in newborns. In budding yeast, buds are made young whereas ageing factors, such as carbonylated proteins and DNA circles, remain confined to the ageing mother cell. The mechanisms of this confinement and their relevance are poorly understood. Here we show that a septin-dependent, lateral diffusion barrier forms in the nuclear envelope and limits the translocation of pre-existing nuclear pores into the bud. The retention of DNA circles within the mother cell depends on the presence of the diffusion barrier and on the anchorage of the circles to pores mediated by the nuclear basket. In accordance with the diffusion barrier ensuring the asymmetric segregation of nuclear age-determinants, the barrier mutant bud6Delta fails to properly reset age in buds. Our data involve septin-dependent diffusion barriers in the confinement of ageing factors to one daughter cell during asymmetric cell division.",

    "abstract": "Telomere length regulation is an important aspect of cell maintenance in eukaryotes, since shortened telomeres can lead to a number of defects, including impaired cell division. Although telomere length is correlated with lifespan in some bird species, its possible role in aging and lifespan determination is still poorly understood. Here we investigate telomere dynamics (changes in telomere length and attrition rate) and telomerase activity in the ant Lasius niger, a species in which different groups of individuals have evolved extraordinarily different lifespans. We found that somatic tissues of the short-lived males had dramatically shorter telomeres than those of the much longer-lived queens and workers. These differences were established early during larval development, most likely through faster telomere shortening in males compared with females. Workers did not, however, have shorter telomeres than the longer-lived queens. We discuss various molecular mechanisms that are likely to cause the observed sex-specific telomere dynamics in ants, including cell division, oxidative stress and telomerase activity. In addition, we discuss the evolutionary causes of such patterns in ants and in other species.",

    "title": "MitomiRs in human inflamm-aging: a hypothesis involving miR-181a, miR-34a and miR-146a.",
    "abstract": "Mitochondria are intimately involved in the aging process. The decline of autophagic clearance during aging affects the equilibrium between mitochondrial fusion and fission, leading to a build-up of dysfunctional mitochondria, oxidative stress, chronic low-grade inflammation, and increased apoptosis rates, the main hallmarks of aging. Current research suggests that a large number of microRNAs (miRs or miRNAs) are differentially expressed during cell aging. Other lines of evidence indicate that several miRs likely share in \"inflamm-aging\", an aging-related state characterized by systemic chronic inflammation that in turn provides a biological background favoring susceptibility to age-related diseases and disabilities. Interestingly, miRs can modulate mitochondrial activity, and a discrete miR set has recently been identified in mitochondria of different species and cell types (mitomiRs). Here we show that some mitomiRs (let7b, mir-146a, -133b, -106a, -19b, -20a, -34a, -181a and -221) are also among the miRs primarily involved in cell aging and in inflamm-aging. Of note, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of aging-related mitomiR targets has disclosed a number of resident mitochondrial proteins playing large roles in energy metabolism, mitochondrial transport and apoptosis. Among these, Bcl-2 family members--which are critically involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity--may play a role in controlling mitochondrial function and dysfunction during cellular aging, also considering that Bcl-2, the master member of the family, is an anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic factor and regulates mitochondrial fission/fusion and autophagy. This intriguing hypothesis is supported by several observations: i) in endothelial cells undergoing replicative senescence (HUVECs), a well-established model of cell senescence, miR-146a, miR-34a, and miR-181a are over-expressed whereas their target Bcl-2 is down-regulated; ii) IPA of the miR-146a, miR-34a and miR-181a network shows that they are closely linked to each other, to Bcl-2 and to mitochondria; and iii) miR-146a, miR-34a, and miR-181a are involved in important cell functions (growth, proliferation, death, survival, maintenance) and age-related diseases (cancer, skeletal and muscle disorders, neurological, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases). In conclusion several aging-related mitomiRs may play a direct role in controlling mitochondrial function by regulating mitochondrial protein expression. Their modulation could thus mediate the loss of mitochondrial integrity and function in aging cells, inducing or contributing to the inflammatory response and to age-related diseases.",

    "title": "Resveratrol protects against age-associated infertility in mice.",
    "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: Does resveratrol counteract age-associated infertility in a mouse model of reproductive aging? SUMMARY ANSWER: Long-term-oral administration of resveratrol protects against the reduction of fertility with reproductive aging in mice. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Loss of oocytes and follicles and reduced oocyte quality contribute to age-associated ovarian aging and infertility. Accumulation of free radicals with age leads to DNA mutations, protein damage, telomere shortening, apoptosis and accelerated ovarian aging. Increasing evidence shows that resveratrol, enriched in certain foods, for example red grapes and wine, has anti-tumor and anti-aging effects on somatic tissues by influencing various signaling pathways, including anti-oxidation, as well as activating Sirt1 and telomerase. We investigated the potential of resveratrol to stave off ovarian aging in the inbred C57/BL6 mouse model. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Young C57/BL6 females (aged 2-3 months) were fed with resveratrol added to drinking water at 30 mg/l (providing ∼7.0 mg/kg/day) for 6 or 12 months, and the fertility and ovarian functions were compared among mice treated with or without resveratrol, and young mice served as reproductive controls. Experiments were repeated three times, with an average of 25 females randomly allocated to each treatment group for each repeat. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Reproductive performance of female mice was determined by litter size, ovarian follicles and oocyte quantity and quality, and compared with age-matched controls. The impact of resveratrol on telomeres and telomerase activity, and expression of genes associated with cell senescence also was evaluated. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Young mice fed with resveratrol for 12 months retained the capacity to reproduce, while age-matched controls produced no pups. Consistently, mice fed with resveratrol for 12 months exhibited a larger follicle pool than controls (P < 0.05). Furthermore, telomerase activity, telomere length and age-related gene expression in ovaries of mice fed with resveratrol resembled those of young mice, but differed (P < 0.05) from those of age-matched old mice. Resveratrol improved (P < 0.05) the number and quality of oocytes, as evidenced by spindle morphology and chromosome alignment. Also, resveratrol affected embryo development in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The doses of resveratrol and the experimental conditions used by different research groups have varied considerably, and the dosage influences both the effectiveness and toxicity of resveratrol. Fine-tuning the dosage of resveratrol likely will optimize its anti-aging effects on ovarian function. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our data provide a proof of principle of the fertility-sparing effect of resveratrol in female mice. Although depletion of the ovarian reserve of high-quality oocytes also contributes to increased infertility with reproductive aging in women, the data obtained using a mouse model may not extrapolate directly to human reproduction, and more extensive research is needed if any clinic trials are to be attempted.

    "abstract": "Inflammation is the body's means of defense against harmful stimuli, with the ultimate aim being to restore homeostasis. Controlled acute inflammation transiently activates an immune response and can be beneficial as protection against infection or injury. However, dysregulated inflammatory responses, including chronic inflammation, disrupt the immune system's ability to maintain homeostatic balance, leading to increased susceptibility to infection, continuous tissue damage, and dysfunction. Aging is a risk factor for chronic inflammation; their coincidence is termed \"inflammaging\". Metabolic disorders including obesity, neurodegenerative diseases, and atherosclerosis are often encountered in old age. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanistic relationship between aging, chronic inflammation, and metabolism. It has been established that the expression of inflammatory mediators is transcriptionally and translationally regulated. In addition, the post-translational modification of the mediators plays a crucial role in the response to inflammatory signaling. Chromatin regulation responds to metabolic status and controls homeostasis. However, chromatin structure is also changed by aging. In this review, we discuss the functional contributions of chromatin regulation to inflammaging.",

    "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) is an essential electron transporter in mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. In genomic DNA, NAD(+) also represents the sole substrate for the nuclear repair enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and the sirtuin family of NAD-dependent histone deacetylases. Age associated increases in oxidative nuclear damage have been associated with PARP-mediated NAD(+) depletion and loss of SIRT1 activity in rodents. In this study, we further investigated whether these same associations were present in aging human tissue. Human pelvic skin samples were obtained from consenting patients aged between 15-77 and newborn babies (0-1 year old) (n = 49) previously scheduled for an unrelated surgical procedure. DNA damage correlated strongly with age in both males (p = 0.029; r = 0.490) and females (p = 0.003; r = 0.600) whereas lipid oxidation (MDA) levels increased with age in males (p = 0.004; r = 0.623) but not females (p = 0.3734; r = 0.200). PARP activity significantly increased with age in males (p<0.0001; r = 0.768) and inversely correlated with tissue NAD(+) levels (p = 0.0003; r = -0.639). These associations were less evident in females. A strong negative correlation was observed between NAD(+) levels and age in both males (p = 0.001; r = -0.706) and females (p = 0.01; r = -0.537). SIRT1 activity also negatively correlated with age in males (p = 0.007; r = -0.612) but not in females. Strong positive correlations were also observed between lipid peroxidation and DNA damage (p<0.0001; r = 0.4962), and PARP activity and NAD(+) levels (p = 0.0213; r = 0.5241) in post pubescent males. This study provides quantitative evidence in support of the hypothesis that hyperactivation of PARP due to an accumulation of oxidative damage to DNA during aging may be responsible for increased NAD(+) catabolism in human tissue. The resulting NAD(+) depletion may play a major role in the aging process, by limiting energy production, DNA repair and genomic signalling.",

    "abstract": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has long been used as a model organism for studying the basic mechanisms of aging. However, the main problem with the use of this unicellular fungus is the unit of \"longevity\". For all organisms, lifespan is expressed in units of time, while in the case of yeast it is defined by the number of daughter cells produced. Additionally, in yeast the phenotypic effects of mutations often show a clear dependence on the genetic background, suggesting the need for an analysis of strains representing different genetic backgrounds. Our results confirm the data presented in earlier papers that the reproductive potential is strongly associated with an increase in cell volume per generation. An excessive cell volume results in the loss of reproductive capacity. These data clearly support the hypertrophy hypothesis. The time of life of all analysed mutants, with the exception of sch9D, is the same as in the case of the wild-type strain. Interestingly, the 121% increase of the fob1D mutant's reproductive potential compared to the sfp1D mutant does not result in prolongation of the mutant's time of life (total lifespan).",

    "abstract": "The ERCC1-XPF heterodimer is a structure-specific endonuclease involved in both nucleotide excision repair and interstrand crosslink repair. Mice carrying a genetic defect in Ercc1 display symptoms suggestive of a progressive, segmental progeria, indicating that disruption of one or both of these DNA damage repair pathways accelerates aging. In the hematopoietic system, there are defined age-associated changes for which the cause is unknown. To determine if DNA repair is critical to prolonged hematopoietic function, hematopoiesis in Ercc1-/- mice was compared to that in young and old wild-type mice. Ercc1-/- mice (3-week-old) exhibited multilineage cytopenia and fatty replacement of bone marrow, similar to old wild-type mice. In addition, the proliferative reserves of hematopoietic progenitors and stress erythropoiesis were significantly reduced in Ercc1-/- mice compared to age-matched controls. These features were not seen in nucleotide excision repair-deficient Xpa-/- mice, but are characteristic of Fanconi anemia, a human cancer syndrome caused by defects in interstrand crosslink repair. These data support the hypothesis that spontaneous interstrand crosslink damage contributes to the functional decline of the hematopoietic system associated with aging.",

    "title": "Expression of bovine superoxide dismutase in Drosophila melanogaster augments resistance of oxidative stress.",
    "abstract": "Superoxide dismutases (SOD) play a major role in the intracellular defense against oxygen radical damage to aerobic cells. In eucaryotes, the cytoplasmic form of the enzyme is a 32-kDa dimer containing two copper and two zinc atoms (CuZn SOD) that catalyzes the dismutation of the superoxide anion (O2-) to H2O2 and O2. Superoxide-mediated damage has been implicated in a number of biological processes, including aging and cancer; however, it is not certain whether endogenously elevated levels of SOD will reduce the pathological events resulting from such damage. To understand the in vivo relationship between an efficient dismutation of O2- and oxidative injury to biological structures, we generated transgenic strains of Drosophila melanogaster overproducing CuZn SOD. This was achieved by microinjecting Drosophila embryos with P-elements containing bovine CuZn SOD cDNA under the control of the Drosophila actin 5c gene promoter. Adult flies of the resulting transformed lines which expressed both mammalian and Drosophila CuZn SOD were then used as a novel model for evaluating the role of oxygen radicals in aging. Our data show that expression of enzymatically active bovine SOD in Drosophila flies confers resistance to paraquat, an O2(-)-generating compound. This is consistent with data on adult mortality, because there was a slight but significant increase in the mean lifespan of several of the transgenic lines. The highest level of expression of the active enzyme in adults was 1.60 times the normal value. Higher levels may have led to the formation of toxic levels of H2O2 during development, since flies that died during the process of eclosion showed an unusual accumulation of lipofuscin (age pigment) in some of their cells. In conclusion, our data show that free-radical detoxification has a minor by positive effect on mean longevity for several strains.",

    "abstract": "The human immune system evolved to defend the organism against pathogens, but is clearly less well able to do so in the elderly, resulting in greater morbidity and mortality due to infectious disease in old people, and higher healthcare costs. Many age-associated immune alterations have been reported over the years, of which probably the changes in T cell immunity, often manifested dramatically as large clonal expansions of cells of limited antigen specificity together with a marked shrinkage of the T cell antigen receptor repertoire, are the most notable. It has recently emerged that the common herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), which establishes persistent, life-long infection, usually asymptomatically, may well be the driving force behind clonal expansions and altered phenotypes and functions of CD8 cells seen in most old people. In those few who are not CMV-infected, another even more common herpesvirus, the Epstein-Barr virus, appears to have the same effect. These virus-driven changes are less marked in \"successfully aged\" centenarians, but most marked in people whom longitudinal studies have shown to be at higher risk of death, that is, those possessing an \"immune risk profile\" (IRP) characterized by an inverted CD4:8 ratio (caused by the accumulation primarily of CD8(+) CD28(-) cells). These findings support the hypothesis that persistent herpesviruses, especially CMV, act as chronic antigenic stressors and play a major causative role in immunosenescence and associated mortality.",
